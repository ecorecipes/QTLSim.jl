# What phenotypic plasticity does to the rate of change a population can sustain: a
# pre-specified experiment with the kernel (ROADMAP F2, stage 3).
#
# Everything from here to "END OF PRE-SPECIFICATION" was written before the first run of
# the main experiment. A pilot WITHOUT plasticity (b = 0 only; `pilot` argument, logged in
# plasticity_rates_pilot.log) was run first, only to place the grid of rates; its
# half-survival rates are the constants K50_PILOT below.
#
# ── Design ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Regime: the published sweep's design (1000 diploids, CrossoverModel = :qtsim, 10,000
# generations of stabilising selection, then the optimum moves continuously), with two
# synthetic parameter sets within the paper's priors, those of validate/gsl_locked.jl's
# synthetic inputs (nothing is read from Repository/):
#   L100: NoQTL 100, u 3, V_P 0.03, h² 0.4, m 0.005, ω 4, μ 1e-4
#   L500: NoQTL 500, u 3, V_P 0.05, h² 0.3, m 0.008, ω 3, μ 1e-4
# Demography: QTSim's fixed size, and Beverton–Holt with R = 2 (K = 1000).
# Plasticity: b/B ∈ {0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75} with B = 1 (OptimumSlope), a perfect cue
# (CueLag = 0); without a cost, and with the cost ω_b = 0.5 (PlasticityCostSD; fitness
# times exp(−b²/(2ω_b²)) = 0.88, 0.61, 0.32 for the three slopes).
# Rates: nine rates per cell, k = K50_PILOT[L, demography] × {0.4, 0.55, 0.7, 0.85, 1, 1.15,
# 1.3, 1.6, 2.2} / (1 − b/B): the same grid of EFFECTIVE rates (1 − b/B)·k in every cell, so
# that under the theory's scaling the survival curves of the no-cost cells coincide.
# Replicates: 40 burn-ins per (parameter set, demography). Without a cost the burn-in does
# not depend on the slope (the optimum is at the origin, so the plastic part is exactly 0;
# tested bitwise in test/runtests.jl), so each burn-in is shared by all four slopes and all
# nine rates (a paired design); with the cost each slope has its own 40 burn-ins. Each
# branch gets its own random numbers after the move. A run is censored 2000 generations
# after the move (as validate/published_sweep.jl's default cap).
#
# ── Measures ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# survival: alive 2000 generations after the move. k50: the rate at which half survive,
# from a logistic regression of survival on ln k over a cell's nine rates (maximum
# likelihood), k50 = exp(−a/c) for logit P(survive) = a + c ln k. Intervals: 95% percentile
# intervals from 1000 bootstrap resamples of the replicates (blocks: a replicate's whole set
# of rates; for ratios within the no-cost design the same resampled replicates in numerator
# and denominator).
#
# ── Predictions and criteria ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# P1 (no cost): k50(b)/k50(0) = 1/(1 − b/B), i.e. 1.33, 2 and 4. PASS for a cell when the
#     estimate of k50(b)(1 − b/B)/k50(0) is within 15% of 1 (0.85–1.15). 12 cells
#     (2 parameter sets × 2 demographies × 3 slopes). The interval is reported; a cell whose
#     interval excludes 1 is flagged even if it passes.
# P2 (cost): k50(b, cost)/k50(0) = sustainable_rate(b, cost)/sustainable_rate(0), evaluated
#     at the cell's mean genetic variance at the move (QTLSim.sustainable_rate: the
#     deterministic threshold of the moments recursion). PASS when observed/predicted is
#     within 25% of 1. For Beverton–Holt with b = 0.75 the prediction is extinction before
#     the move (R·W̄ = 2·0.997·0.32 < 1): PASS when at least 90% of the burn-ins die out.
#     12 cells, of which 2 are of the second kind.
# P3 (lag, no cost): at equal effective rate the steady lag is the same. At the two lowest
#     rates of the grid, the ratio of the mean lag θ − z̄ over generations 500–2000 after the
#     move (runs alive at 2000) to that at b = 0 is within 15% of 1. 12 cells.
# Descriptive, no criterion: k50 against sustainable_rate itself (the deterministic
# threshold should overestimate), survival by rate, and the median time to extinction.
# The headline number is the P1 ratio: how much the half-survival rate rises with b/B.
# Failures stay in the log. If the model or the script's analysis is changed after a
# failed run, the change is stated here and confirmed with fresh seeds (SEED0).
#
# END OF PRE-SPECIFICATION
#
# Run from the package root, at most 3 threads (about 1.5 CPU-hours):
#   julia -t 3 --project=. validate/plasticity_rates.jl pilot     # places the grid (b = 0 only)
#   julia -t 3 --project=. validate/plasticity_rates.jl [SEED0]   # the experiment; resumes from its CSV
# Writes validate/plasticity_rates.csv (one row per run) and prints the analysis, logged in
# validate/plasticity_rates.log.
